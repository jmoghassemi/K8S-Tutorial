# K8S-Tutorial
This project will examine how to create and deploy a light-weight Kubernetes cluster (using K3D/K3S) and installing some added features to the cluster using open-source software. These add-ons include CI/CD pipelines using Tekton, and monitoring features that provide information about the health of the cluster using Grafana/Loki.
Having an application running in the cluster is essential for this tutorial to demonstarte the different capabilities of Kubernetes. The application chosen for this tutorial is a Python app that communicates with a MySQL database and executes CRUD commands on the database.
